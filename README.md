# FrOS

## Description

This is a simple x86 32 bit operating system written from scratch, based on Carlos Fenollosas [OS tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial). It contains the following components:

1. Boot loader
2. Operating system kernel, including
    1. ISRs to handle CPU interrupts
    2. VGA driver
    3. Keyboard driver
    4. Shell
    5. Dynamic memory allocation

## Setup

### Install Assembler and Emulator

```bash
brew install qemu nasm
```

### Install Kernel Compiler

https://github.com/lordmilko/i686-elf-tools#mac-os-x

```
brew install i386-elf-binutils
brew install i386-elf-gcc
brew install i386-elf-gdb
```

```
export PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/x86_64-elf-binutils/<version>/bin/:/usr/local/Cellar/x86_64-elf-gcc/<version>/bin/:/usr/local/Cellar/i386-elf-gdb/<version>/bin:$PATH"
```

## Usage

### Boot

```
make run
```

### Debug

```
make debug
```

In GDB shell:

- Set breakpoint at function (e.g. `start_kernel`): `b start_kernel`
- Start execution: `c`
- Jump to next instruction: `n`
- Print variable: `p <variable_name>`
